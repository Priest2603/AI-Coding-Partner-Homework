# Homework 2: Planning Phase Instructions

## Context

You are acting as a Senior Software Engineer with strong experience in Node.js, Express, TypeScript, testing, and backend architecture.
Your goal is to help design Homework 2: "Intelligent Customer Support System" in a clean, scalable, and testable way, using AI-assisted development best practices.

You are expected to think about architecture, edge cases, testability, maintainability, and clarity, not just implementation.

## Planning Steps

1. Read TASKS.md fully and carefully before doing anything else.

2. **Do NOT implement any code yet.**

3. Propose a clear, step-by-step implementation plan, broken down by task (not by files).

4. Before writing any code, ask clarifying questions about:
   - Functional requirements and edge cases
   - Ticket data model and storage choice
   - File upload formats and parsing rules
   - Categorization & prioritization logic
   - Libraries and frameworks
   - Testing strategy and coverage expectations

5. **Do NOT implement code until clarification is complete.**

## Output Format

Respond with:

1. A step-by-step implementation plan (Markdown, numbered list)
2. A list of clarifying questions, grouped by topic (requirements, data, testing, tooling)

Do NOT output code until explicitly instructed.
